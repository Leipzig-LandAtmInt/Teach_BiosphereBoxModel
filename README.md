# Teach_EcoBoxModel
# This is a simple 6 box model for the terrestrial biosphere carbon fluxes. It has been prepared by Ana Bastos (ana.bastos@uni-leipzig.de) for teaching courses on carbon cycle modelling and is based on the model dedescribed in Emanuel et al. in Bolin et al. (1981, SCOPE-16).

It is organised in a jupyter notebook with a step-by-step explanation of the model structure and implementation. 

You can open the file 2023_ModellingBiosphere.ipynb in as a jupter notebook, or convert directly to another format by running in the command line:

jupyter nbconvert --execute 2023_ModellingBiosphere.ipynb --to html


The excercise includes forcing the model with atmospheric CO2 concentration changes. The respective file is provided as a CSV file "CO2_LawDome_GCP.csv"


Any questions and suggestions for improvement are welcome.
