# Teaching Excercise Terrestrial Biosphere C modelling

## Description
This is a simple 6 box model for the terrestrial biosphere carbon fluxes, prepared by Ana Bastos for teaching courses on carbon cycle modelling.
It is organised in a jupyter notebook with a step-by-step explanation of the model structure and implementation. 
You can open the file 2023_ModellingBiosphere.ipynb in as a jupter notebook, or convert directly to another format by running in the command line:

`jupyter nbconvert --execute 2023_ModellingBiosphere.ipynb --to html`

The course includes an excercise where we force the model with atmospheric CO2 concentration changes. 
The respective file is provided as a CSV file "CO2_LawDome_GCP.csv"

## Source
The model described here is based on Emanuel et al. in Bolin et al. (1981, SCOPE-16).
